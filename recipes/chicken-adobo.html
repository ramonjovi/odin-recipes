    <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                <li>5 chicken drumsticks (about 1 3/4 pounds)</li>
                <li>5 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds)</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
                <li>8 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                <li>5 bay leaves</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 cup cane vinegar (see Tips) or unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
                <li>⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer. Add drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add thighs to the pot and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks.</li>
                <li>Add onion, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce.</li>
            </ol>
